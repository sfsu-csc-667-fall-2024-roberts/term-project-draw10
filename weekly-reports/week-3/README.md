3. Overview: This week, our group followed the Milestone 3 instructions to set up code to support future front-end logic for our Uno game. We installed webpack to minimize <script> tags in our code, livereload to see our changes more efficiently while working on the project, and the webpack process "concurrently". Finally, we added individual routes for all the main pages that we outlined in our wireframes: login, signup, gameslist, creategame, gamelobby, game, and gameresult.
4. The changes and new additions have been pushed to our GitHub repository.
