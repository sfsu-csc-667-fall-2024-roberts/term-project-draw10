3. Overview: This week, our group set up the development environment for the back end of our term project by following the Milestone 2 instructions given to us. We created the directories to hold our project's code, and installed the required tools through node, like dotenv, nodemon, http-errors, ejs, morgan, cookie-parser, and husky. We imported these dependencies and middleware to help set up and execute the server in our src/server/index.ts file.
4. The basic skeleton of our project is set up and pushed to our GitHub repository.
