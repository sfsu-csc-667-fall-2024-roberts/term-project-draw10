3. Overview: This week, our group followed the Milestone 4 instructions to set up authentication for our game. We refactored our code to make logging in and registering go through an "auth" route, and made temporary fields on those pages to allow users to type their credentials. However, we've had problems creating our database and implementing sessions.
4. The changes and new additions have been pushed to our GitHub repository.
